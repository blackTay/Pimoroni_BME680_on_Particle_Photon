# Pimoroni_BME680_On_Particle_Photon

All credit goes to Adafruit who created this library and those who adapted it to the photon.

This script uses the 0x76 address of the Pimoroni Sensor, therefore you don't have to jumper it.

## Wiring

D0 = SDA; D1=SCl
I use the 3.3V to power the sensor

In a later stage i might use a % readout for the air quality after a certain sensor priming time.
